I'm the developer behind BoomchainLabs (@agunnaya001 on Twitter), and I just launched Creator Coin Spin - a Web3 game that I think will change how you think about crypto gaming.

- Premium spins with 5x and 25x multipliers
- No gas fees for players (I cover them)
- Provably fair spins

🎮 **Smooth Gameplay**

                'text': '''Hey r/WebDev!

Just finished a fun project - Creator Coin Spin, a Web3 game with some seriously impressive visual effects, all built with vanilla JavaScript!

**Tech Stack:**
- **Backend:** Python Flask + SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS (no React/Vue/Angular!)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with animations
- **Blockchain:** Web3.py + ethers.js
- **Database:** SQLite with migrations
- **Deployment:** Vercel-ready

**The Challenge:**
Create AAA-quality visual effects without heavy frameworks:
- 80-particle celebration systems
- Firework burst animations
- Cosmic background with animated stars/nebulae
- Smooth 60fps mobile performance
- 5 different theme variations

**What I Learned:**
1. **Vanilla JS is powerful** - No need for React for this type of interactivity
2. **CSS animations + JS coordination** - Perfect combo for game effects
3. **Performance matters** - Particle pooling and cleanup is crucial
4. **Mobile-first** - Touch interactions and responsive design from day 1

**Interesting Technical Bits:**
- Custom particle physics engine in ~200 lines of JS
- CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
- Web3 signature verification (no gas fees for users)
- Responsive particle counts based on device performance

The visual effects genuinely rival mobile games, and it's all web-native!
